The key differences between absolute and relative positioning in CSS are in how they affect an element's
position and its interaction with other elements on the page:

Relative Positioning (position: relative;)
Positioning Context: The element remains within the normal document flow, meaning it takes up space as
it normally would.Movement: Shifting the element using top, bottom, left, or right properties moves it
relative to its default position, without affecting other elements' positions.

Effect on Layout:
Other elements on the page aren't affected by the shifted element; they behave as if the element is in its 
original position.
Ancestor Influence: The positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position or relative to 
its closest positioned ancestor.



Absolute Positioning (position: absolute;)
Positioning Context: The element is taken out of the normal document flow and doesn't occupy space in 
the layout, allowing other elements to flow around it.
Movement: Positioning with top, bottom, left, or right properties places the element precisely based on 
its closest positioned ancestor or the document body if no ancestor has a positioning context.

Effect on Layout: Other elements ignore the absolutely positioned element, meaning they won't be
affected by its movement or absence in the layout.
Ancestor Influence: The element is positioned relative to its closest ancestor with a positioning context,
typically using position: relative;, position: absolute;, or position: fixed;.
