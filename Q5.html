<!-- The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements on a web page, allowing you to 
specify which elements should appear in front of or behind others. It works along the z-axis, 
perpendicular to the screen.

Basic Explanation:
Higher Values: Elements with a higher z-index value appear in front of elements with lower values or
 the default value.
Stacking Context: The z-index property only works on positioned elements (position: relative, position: 
absolute, or position: fixed).
Example: -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .red {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: red;
      position: absolute;
      top: 50px;
      left: 50px;
      z-index: 1; /* Lower z-index */
    }

    .blue {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: blue;
      position: absolute;
      top: 70px;
      left: 70px;
      z-index: 2; /* Higher z-index */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="red"></div>
<div class="blue"></div>

</body>
</html>


<!-- Explanation:
In this example, there are two positioned elements: a red square and a blue square.
The red square has a z-index of 1, and the blue square has a z-index of 2.
The blue square, having a higher z-index, will stack on top of the red square because it's set to 2,
 while the red square's z-index is 1. -->
